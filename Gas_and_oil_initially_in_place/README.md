GIIP denote the total estimated quantity (volume) of natural gas contained in a "subsurface" asset prior to extraction (production)
GIIP =(43560AhQ(1-Swc))/Bg
OIIP- the amount of crude oil first estimated to be in a reservoir. Oil initially in place differs from oil reserves, as OIIP refers to the total amount of oil that is potentially in a reservoir and not the amount of oil that can be recovered.
STOIIP=(7758AhQ(1-Swc))/Boi
Estimating GIIP and OIIP accurately is crucial for several reasons:
Resource Management: Helps in planning the development and management of the reservoir.
Economic Evaluation: Provides a basis for economic analysis and decision-making.
Production Forecasting: Aids in predicting future production rates and recovery factors.
Understanding these concepts allows reservoir engineers to optimize extraction processes, manage resources efficiently, and ensure sustainable production.
